# Course objective
- The key objective of the course is **applying** microeconometric techniques rather than **deriving** econometric and statistical properties of estimators
- In other words, there’s way less of this

$$\text{plim} \hat{\beta}_{OLS} = \beta + \text{plim} (\frac{1}{N}X'X)^{-1} \text{plim} \frac{1}{N} X' \varepsilon = \beta + Q^{-1} \text{plim} \frac{1}{N} X' \varepsilon$$

- And way more of this

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(fixest)

df <- tibble(groups = sort(rep(1:10, 600)), 
             time = rep(sort(rep(1:6, 100)), 10),
             Treated = I(groups > 5) * I(time > 3),
             Y = groups + time + 5*Treated + rnorm(6000))
did <- feols(Y ~ Treated | groups + time, data = df)
```

- If you would like to go deeper into the former, take Advanced Econometrics I and II next year

# Goal for today's tutorial

1. Use a tobit model to estimate censored data
1. Discuss a sample selection model and implement the selection mechanism
1. Work with strong and weak instrumental variables
1. Test instrumental variables
1. Work with a quantile regression and discuss inference tools

---

# Censored regression

- Censoring occurs when the value of a variable is limited due to some constraint
  - for example, we tend not to see some values of self-declared earnings with discrete categories (if you earn **at least** $3500$ euro per month, write $3500$)
- In this case OLS estimates are biased
  - a standard method to account for censoring is to combine a probit model with OLS, i.e. **tobit model**

---

# Censored regression: simulation

- The clearest way to understand how a certain estimator works is to generate data yourself so you know the true **data generating process** - DGP
- Let's estimate returns to education: does education increase wages?
- Let's assume the following model
$$Y_i = \alpha + X_i' \beta_1 + U_i$$
where $Y_i$ are monthly wages, $X_i$ are years of education
- But suppose that we do not observe wages above a specific threshold (due to the features of a questionnaire, privacy concerns, coding, etc.)
  - how can we estimate the model in this case?
- First, we need to generate data containing years of education and wages

---

# Censored regression: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Always set seed so you can replicate your results
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(education = runif(1000, 5, 15),
             wage_star = 1000 + 200*education + rnorm(1000, 0, 100),
             wage = ifelse(wage_star > 3500, 3500, wage_star))  %>%
      arrange(wage_star)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df %>%
  slice(c(1:4, 997:1000)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Censored regression: OLS

- Now let's pretend that we do not know the DGP and simply apply OLS

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ols_model <- lm(wage ~ education, df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(ols_model, stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- Using these OLS estimates, we would wrongly conclude that "an additional year of education is associated with $`r round(ols_model$coefficients[2], 3)`$ increase in monthly wages"
  - if we think that we **causally** identified the effect we'd say "an additional year of education **causes** $`r round(ols_model$coefficients[2], 3)`$ increase in monthly wages"

---

# Censored regression: tobit model

- But these are biased estimates since we know the true effect is $200$ (remember DGP)
- Let's try to recover unbiased effects of education on wages by using a **tobit model**
- The solution provided by a tobit model is to
  - use a probit model to account for the censoring 
  - estimate OLS on the non-censored data
- Tobit model estimator is easy to implement with `censReg` package 

---

# Censored regression: tobit model

- Remember that we have right censored data: wages above $3500$ are coded as $3500$

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(censReg)
tobit_model <- censReg(wage ~ education, data = df, right = 3500)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(tobit_model, stars = TRUE,  gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- We recovered the **unbiased** estimates of returns to education

---

# Censored regression: graphically

- We will use a lot of graphs since they provide more intuition of what is happening

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = education, y = wage)) + 
  theme_light() +
  geom_point(aes(color = 'dark grey')) +
  geom_abline(color = 'red', intercept = ols_model[["coefficients"]][["(Intercept)"]], slope = ols_model[["coefficients"]][["education"]]) + 
  geom_abline(color = 'blue', intercept = tobit_model[["estimate"]][["(Intercept)"]], slope = tobit_model[["estimate"]][["education"]]) + 
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c("Observed data" = "dark grey", 
                                                   "OLS" = "red",
                                                   "Tobit" = "blue"))
```

---

# Censored regression: some remarks

- You can specify both left and right censoring using `censReg()` function
- Important assumption of a tobit model is that the unobserved term is normally distributed (which is the case in our simulated data set)
- What if the data is missing not because the outcome variable is **above (or below)** some threshold but because individuals in the data have made a **choice** such that we can't observe their outcome variable?
- In this case censoring cannot be applied because the availability of data is **influenced** by the choice of agents
  - it is called **selection on unobservables**
  - it is a typical **sample selection problem**

---

# Sample selection model

- Let us consider the case of studying female’s wages
  - usually, wages are observed for a fraction of women in the sample, whereas the remaining part of women are observed as unemployed or inactive
  - if we run an OLS regression using the observed wages, this would deliver consistent estimations only if working females are a **random sample** of the population
- However, theory of labor supply suggests that this may not be the case, since (typically) female labor supply is sensitive to household decisions
  - that is, female workers **self-select** into employment, and the self-selection is not random
  - this difference may lead us to underestimate the gender wage gap

---

# Sample selection model

- Suppose a female worker decides to work or not based on a latent variable $I_i^*$ (say, utility derived from working), which depends on a set of observed $Z_i$ and unobserved $V_i$ characteristics
$$I_i^* = Z_i ' \gamma + V_i$$
- The indicator function (decision to work or not), based on $I_i^*$, takes two values
$$I_i = \begin{cases} \mbox{} 1 \text{ (working) } \ & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i^* > 0 \\ \mbox{} 0 \text{ (not working) } & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i^* \leq 0 \end{cases}$$
- Suppose there is a latent outcome $Y_i^*$, i.e. wages of female workers, which depend on a set of observed $X_i$ and unobserved $U_i$ characteristics
$$Y_i^* = X_i ' \beta + U_i$$
- However, we observe wages only for females who decide to work: $Y_i$ are observed wages
$$Y_i = \begin{cases} \mbox{} Y_i^* \ & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i = 1 \\ \mbox{} \text{missing} & \mbox{} \text{ if } I_i = 0 \end{cases}$$

---

# Sample selection model: assumptions

- As always we need to have some assumptions, for example, in an OLS regression we usually assume $U_i \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \sigma^2)$)
- To estimate the sample selection model, we make an assumption that disturbances terms are bivariate normal

\begin{align*}
  \left[\begin{array}{l}
    U_{i} \\
    V_{i}
  \end{array}\right] \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\left[\begin{array}{cc}
    \sigma^{2} & \rho \sigma \\
    \rho \sigma & 1
  \end{array}\right]\right)
\end{align*}

- Note that the variance of the normal distribution is not identified in the probit model, so it is set to 1

---

# Sample selection model: simulation

- Let's simulate a data set with the selection mechanism

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(mvtnorm) # to simulate bivariate normal random variable
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(z = runif(1000),
             x = runif(1000),
             uv = rmvnorm(1000, mean = c(0, 0), 
                  sigma = rbind(c(2, 0.7), 
                                c(0.7, 1))),
             i_star = 4 - 5 * z + uv[, 1],
             y_star = 6 - 3 * x + uv[, 2], 
             y = ifelse(i_star > 0, y_star, 0)) # this is a selection mechanism
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df)
```

---

# Sample selection model: simulation

- The true effect of $Z$ on $I$ (decision to work) is $-5$ and the effect $X$ on $Y$ (wages) is $-3$ 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
selection_equation <- glm(I(y > 0) ~ z, df, family = binomial(link = "probit"))
wage_equation <- lm(y ~ x, df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(selection_equation, wage_equation), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- Clearly, the estimates are biased since $\text{cov} (U_i, V_i) \neq 0$

---

# Sample selection model: Heckman

- To solve the sample selection problem, one needs to use the **Heckman selection model** (left as an exercise in the $1^{\text{st}}$ assignment)
  - the Heckman estimator is very similar to the Tobit estimator 
  - the difference is that this estimator allows for a set of characteristics that **determine** whether or not the outcome variable is censored

---

# IV

- The basic idea of the IV estimator is to
  - use the instrument to predict treatment
  - use that predicted treatment to predict the outcome
- We need a separate equation for each of these steps
  - **First stage**: predict treatment $X_1$ with the instrument $Z$ and a control variable $X_2$
$$X_1 = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1Z + \gamma_2X_2 + V$$
  - **Second stage**: use these predictions to predict $Y$
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\hat{X_1} + \beta_2X_2 + U$$
- Notice that we need to use all exogenous variables in both stages

---

# IV: conditions

- For the IV to work, we need two things to hold
  - **Validity**: the instrument must actually be exogenous (or at least exogenous after adding controls)
$$\text{cov}(Z, U) = 0$$
  - **Relevance**: the instrument must be a strong predictor of the treatment. It can't be trivial or unimportant
$$\text{cov}(X_1, Z) \neq 0$$

---

# IV: small-sample bias

- IV is actually a **biased** estimator
  - the mean of its sampling distribution is not the population parameter
  - it would be the population parameter at infinite sample size, but we don't have that
  - in small samples, the **bias of IV** is
$$\frac{\text{cov} (Z, U)}{\text{cov} (X_1, Z)} = \frac{\text{corr} (Z, U)}{\text{corr} (X_1, Z)} \frac{\sigma_U}{\sigma_{X_1}}$$
- If $Z$ is valid, then in infinite samples $\text{cov} (Z, U) = 0$ and this goes away
- But in a non-infinite sample, it will be nonzero by chance, inducing some bias
- The bias is smaller
  - the stronger the relationship between $X_1$ and $Z$
  - the smaller the sum of squared errors
  - the bigger the variation in $X_2$
  - the bigger the sample
- What happens when $\text{corr}(X_1, Z)$ is small?

---

# Weak IV

- If $Z$ has only a trivial effect on $X$, then it's not **relevant** (even if it's truly **exogenous**)
  - our **small-sample bias** will be big (remember the formula on the previous slide)
- Thus, **weak IV** means that we probably shouldn't be using IV in small samples
  - this also means that it's really important that $\text{corr} (X_1, Z)$ is not small
- There are rules of thumb for how strong IV must be to be counted as "not weak"
  - t-statistic above $3$
  - F-statistic from a joint test of the instruments that is $10$ or above
- These rules of thumb aren't great
  - selecting a model on the basis of significance naturally biases your results
  - what you really want is to know the **population effect** of $Z$ on $X_1$ - you want the F-statistic from that to be bigger than $10$. Of course, we don't actually know that

---

# Weak IV: estimation

- There are a bunch of ways to do the IV analysis
  - the classic one is `ivreg()` in the `AER` package
- Other functions are more fully-featured, including robust SEs, clustering, and fixed effects
  - `feols()` in `fixest`
  - `felm()` in `lfe`
  - `tsls()` in `sem`
  - multile functions in `ivpack`

- We'll be using `feols()` from `fixest`

---

# Weak IV: simulation

- Let's create a data set with an instrument

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(fixest)
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(z1 = rnorm(1000),
             u1 = rnorm(1000),
             # x1 is endogenous since it correlates with u1 by construction
             x1 = 0.2*z1 + 4*u1 + rnorm(1000),
             y1 = 3*x1 + 5*u1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df, 4) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Weak IV: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
library(fixest)
ols_model <- lm(y1 ~ x1, df)
iv_model <- feols(y1 ~ 1 | x1 ~ z1, df, se = 'hetero')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(ols_model, iv_model), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)', coef_omit = "(Intercept)")
```

- $Z_1$ is a pretty effective instrument even if the correlation between $Z_1$ and $X_1$ is small
  - check validity: $\text{corr} (Z_1, U_1) =$ `r round(cor(df$z1, df$u1), 3)`, pretty close to zero
  - check relevance: $\text{corr} (X_1, Z_1) =$  `r round(cor(df$x1, df$z1), 3)`, so it's a weak instrument

---

# Weak IV: simulation

- Remember that usually we can't test the **validity** assumption when we have one instrument, but we know the DGP in this case
- Now let's see what happens when there is a small correlation between $Z$ and $U$
- Imagine there is some additional explanatory variable $V$ which is unobserved but partially explains the instrument

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(v = rnorm(1000),
             z2 = -v + rnorm(1000),
             u2 = 0.1*v + rnorm(1000),
             x2 = 0.2*z2 + 4*u2 + rnorm(1000), # all coefficients stay the same here
             y2 = 3*x2 + 5*u2) # and here
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df, 4) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Weak IV: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
ols_model2 <- lm(y2 ~ x2, df)
iv_model2 <- feols(y2 ~ 1 | x2 ~ z2, data = df, se = 'hetero')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(ols_model2, iv_model2), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)', coef_omit = "(Intercept)")
```

- In this case we get a better estimate by using the OLS estimator than by using IV 
- Why? Because of the weak instrument problem and the bias
  - check validity: $\text{corr} (Z_2, U_2) =$ `r round(cor(df$z2, df$u2), 3)`
  - check relevance: $\text{corr} (X_2, Z_2) =$ `r round(cor(df$x2, df$z2), 3)`

---

# Weak IV: simulation

- These results are primarily a function of the weakness of $Z$ at explaining $X$. Let's see what happens if $Z$ has more explanatory power

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(v = rnorm(1000),
             z2 = -v + rnorm(1000),
             u2 = 0.1*v + rnorm(1000),
             # we only change the coefficient for z2 in the equation for x3
             x3 = 3*z2 + 4*u2 + rnorm(1000),
             y2 = 3*x3 + 5*u2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(df, 4) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Weak IV: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
ols_model3 <- lm(y2 ~ x3, df)
iv_model3 <- feols(y2 ~ 1 | x3 ~ z2, data = df, se = 'hetero')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(ols_model3, iv_model3), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)', coef_omit = "(Intercept)")
```

- Even though the correlation between $Z$ and $U$ is the same as previously, the strength of the instrument in explaining $X$ wins out and gives us a better estimator than OLS
  - check validity: $\text{corr} (Z_2, U_2) =$ `r round(cor(df$z2, df$u2), 3)`
  - check relevance: $\text{corr} (X_3, Z_2) =$ `r round(cor(df$x3, df$z2), 3)`

---

# Weak IV: F-test

- Let's look at the F-test from the output of `feols()`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
iv_model3
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
thef <- fitstat(iv_model3, 'ivf')[["ivf1::x3"]][["stat"]]
```

- `r scales::number(thef, accuracy = 0.01)` is way above 10
- Lee, D., et al. (2021) discuss the potentially severe large-sample distortions from using conventional value of the F-test equal to $10$ and they suggest to use as a rule of thumb the minimum value of the F-test equal to $104.7$, which is needed to ensure a test with a significance level $0.05$

---

# Weak IV: overidentification test

- **Overidentification** just means we have more identifying conditions (**validity assumptions**) than we actually need
  - we only need one instrument, but we have two (or more)
  - so we can compare what we get using each instrument individually
- If we assume that **at least one of them is valid**, and they both produce similar results, then that's evidence that **both** are valid

---

# Weak IV: overidentification test

- We can do this using `fitstat()` in `fixest`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
# Create data where z1 is valid and z2 is invalid
df <- tibble(z1 = rnorm(1000), 
             z2 = rnorm(1000),
             x = z1 + z2 + rnorm(1000),
             y = 2*x + z2 + rnorm(1000))

iv <- feols(y ~ 1 | x ~ z1 + z2, df, se = 'hetero')
fitstat(iv, 'sargan')
```

- The null hypothesis of the **Sargan test** is that the covariance between the instruments and the error term is zero
$$\text{corr} (Z, U) = 0$$
- Thus, rejecting the null indicates that at least one of the instruments is not valid
- So we reject the null, indicating that one of the instruments is endogenous (although without seeing the true DGP we couldn't guess if it were $Z_1$ or $Z_2$)

---

# Weak IV: overidentification test

- The true effect is $2$

```{r, echo = TRUE}
iv1 <- feols(y ~ 1 | x ~ z1, df, se = 'hetero')
iv2 <- feols(y ~ 1 | x ~ z2, df, se = 'hetero')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(iv1, iv2), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

---

# Quantile regression

- Consider a very simple OLS
$$Y_i = \alpha + D_i' \beta_1 + U_i$$
where $Y_i$ is an outcome variable, $D_i$ is a treatment variable
- What is the interpretation of the effect of $D_i$ on $Y_i$?
  - it is the expected change in the outcome for a person moving from untreated to treated
  - in other words, it characterizes the **mean** of our outcome variable

---

# Quantile regression

- What if we care about other things but the mean?
  - what are the effects of a subsidized insurance policy on medical expenditures for people with low-, medium-, and high- expenditures?
  - what are the effects of a training program on employment opportunities for people with different years of education?
- Quantile regression can handle such questions
- Quantile regression also solves problems with
  - skewed variables – no more worrying about logs or outliers in the outcome variable
  - censoring
- But it has its own issues
  - it is noisier
  - it is challenging to interpret in an intuitive way
- If you have underlying theory that has implications for distribution of the effects, the quantile regression is the right tool for empirical analysis

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- Let's simulate a data set with normal random errors with a non-constant variance

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(x = seq(0, 1000, length.out = 1000),
             # non-constant variance
             sig = 0.1 + 0.05*x,
             y = 6 + 0.1*x + rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = sig))
```

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- We can see the increasing variability: as $X$ gets bigger, $Y$ becomes more variable

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  theme_light() + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ols_qr <- lm(y ~ x, df)
```

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- The estimated mean of an OLS regression $`r round(ols_qr[["coefficients"]][["x"]], 3)`$ is still unbiased
  - but it doesn’t tell us much about the relationship between $X$ and $Y$
  - especially as $X$ gets larger
- To perform quantile regression, use the `quantreg` package and specify $\text{tau}$ - a quantile

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(quantreg)
qr <- rq(y ~ x, df, tau = 0.9)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary.rq(qr)
```

- The $X$ coefficient estimate of $`r round(qr[["coefficients"]][["x"]], 3)`$ says that "one unit increase in $X$ is associated with $`r round(qr[["coefficients"]][["x"]], 3)`$ increase in the $90^{\text{th}}$ quantile of $Y$"
- The "lower bd" and "upper bd" values are confidence intervals calculated using the rank method

---

# Quantile regression: simulation

- Let's look at different quantiles at once

```{r, echo = TRUE}
qr2 <- rq(y ~ x, data = df, tau = seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1))
coef(qr2)
```

- The intercept estimates don’t change much but the slopes steadily increase

# Quantile regression: simulation

- Let's plot our quantile estimates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_quantile(quantiles = seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1))
```

# Quantile regression: simulation

- Each black dot is the slope coefficient for the quantile indicated on the x axis
- The red lines are the OLS estimate and its confidence interval
- Lower and upper quantiles are well beyond the OLS estimate

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.3}
plot(summary(qr2), parm = "x")
```

# Quantile regression: inference

- There are several alternative methods of conducting inference about quantile regression coefficients
  - rank-inversion confidence intervals: `summary.rq(qr)` 
  - more conventional standard errors: `summary.rq(qr, se = "nid")`
  - bootstraped stanard errors: `summary.rq(qr, se = "boot")`
- To read more about calculating confidence intervals, use `?summary.rq`
