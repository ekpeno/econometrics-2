# Goal for today's tutorial

1. Discuss and estimate a basic framework of DiD as two-way fixed effects estimator
1. Discuss and estimate an event-study specification
1. Discuss how to make proper inferences about DiD estimates
1. Discuss parallel trend assumption, pre-trend tests, and the connection between the two

# DiD as two-way fixed effects

- The basic idea is to take fixed effects and then compare the **within variation** across groups
  - a **treated** group: individuals who get treated
  - a **control** group: individuals who do not get treated
  - we need to observe them both **before** and **after** they (don't) get their treatment
- Eventually, we want to estimate **within variation** for groups
  - control for time effects
  - control for group effects
  - compare within variation across groups
  - sounds like a job for the fixed effects estimator
- The question DiD tries to answer is "what was the effect of some policy on the people who were affected by it?"
  - so, DiD estimates ATET under constant treatment effect assumption with two periods only

---

# DiD as two-way fixed effects

- We can estimate a standard DiD using the following formula
$$Y_{gt} = \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta D_{gt} + U_{gt}$$
where 
  - $\alpha_t$ is the common time trend
  - $\eta_g$ is the group specific effect
  - $D_{gt}$ is is an interaction term equal to $1$ if you are in the treated group in the post-treatment period
  - $\delta$ is the DiD estimate
---

# DiD as two-way fixed effects

- If you have only two groups and two time periods you can present this regression as follows
$$Y_{gt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1Post_t + \beta_2Treated_g + \beta_3Post_t \times Treated_g + U_{gt}$$
where 
  - $Post_t$ is a binary variable equal to $1$ if you are in the post-treatment period
  - $Treated_g$ is a binary variable equal to $1$ if you are in the treated group
  - $Treated_g \times Post_t$ is an interaction term equal to $1$ if you are in the treated group in the post-treatment period

---

# DiD as two-way fixed effects

- How can we interpret the estimated coefficients?

$$Y_{gt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1Post_t + \beta_2Treated_g + \beta_3Post_t \times Treated_g + U_{gt}$$
- $\beta_0$ is the prediction when $Post_t = 0$ and $Treated_g = 0$
  - $\beta_0$ is the **mean of the control group before**
- $\beta_1$ is the prediction when $Post_t = 1$ and $Treated_g = 0$, i.e. difference between periods before and after for the control group
  - $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ is the **mean of the control group after**
- $\beta_2$ is the prediction when $Post_t = 0$ and $Treated_g = 1$, i.e. difference between treated and control groups
  - $\beta_0 + \beta_2$ is the **mean of the treated group before**
- $\beta_3$ is the prediction when $Post_t = 1$ and $Treated_g = 1$, i.e. is how much bigger the before-after difference for the control and treated groups - DiD
  - $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ is the **mean of the treated group after**

# 2 $\times$ 2 DiD: simulation

- Let us simulate a dataset with $2$ groups and $2$ time periods

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(year = rep(1:2, 5000),
             group = sort(rep(0:1, 5000)), 
             post = ifelse(year == 2, 1, 0),
             treated = ifelse(group == 1, 1, 0),
             D = post*treated,
             Y = 3*D + year + group + rnorm(10000))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df %>%
  slice(c(4999:5002)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# 2 $\times$ 2 DiD: simulation

- First, let us manually calculate DiD

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
means <- df %>% group_by(treated, post) %>% summarize(Y = mean(Y))
means
treated_dif <- means[means$treated == 1 & means$post == 1,]$Y - 
               means[means$treated == 1 & means$post == 0,]$Y
control_dif <- means[means$treated == 0 & means$post == 1,]$Y - 
               means[means$treated == 0 & means$post == 0,]$Y
did <- treated_dif - control_dif
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
c(treated_dif, control_dif, did)
```

---

# 2 $\times$ 2 DiD: simulation

- Now let us use `feols()` in `fixest` package as DiD is the FE estimator

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
library(fixest)
m1 <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df,
            se = 'standard') # no need to cluster s.e. 
                             # as there are only 2 groups and 2 time periods
# We can estimate DiD using simple lm()
m2 <- lm(Y ~ D + factor(year) + factor(group), df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(m1, m2), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)', coef_omit = "[^D]")
```

# DiD: more groups and time periods

- Let us simulate a dataset with $20$ groups and $10$ time periods 
  - with first treated period being period $7$ 
  - and the treated groups being $15$ and $20$

```{r, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(7)
df <- tibble(year = rep(1:10, 1000),
             group = sort(rep(1:20, 500)), 
             post = ifelse(year >= 7, 1, 0),
             treated = ifelse(group >= 15, 1, 0),
             D = post*treated,
             Y = 3*D + year + group + rnorm(10000))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df %>%
  slice(c(9995:9998)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# DiD: simulation

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
library(fixest)
m <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(m, stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

# DiD: inference

- Always remember what the level of your treatment is
  - is your treatment assigned at the level of state?
  - is your treatment assigned at the level of university?
  - is your treatment assigned at the level of class?
- If you have not done so, read a paper by Abadie et al. 2017 
- It’s common to cluster s.e. at the level of the fixed effects, since it seems likely that errors would be correlated over time
  - not accounting for clustering leads to incorrect s.e.
  - `feols()` clusters by the first FE by default

---

# DiD: inference

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
m1 <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df, se = 'standard')
m2 <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df, cluster = "year")
m3 <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df, cluster = "group")
m4 <- feols(Y ~ D | year + group, df, cluster = "year^group")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(m1, m2, m3, m4), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num|Std.)')
```

- Remember that how you calculate your s.e. **does not** affect point estimates

---

# DiD: event-study specification

- We've limited ourselves to "before" and "after" but this is not all we have
- But that averages out the treatment across the entire "after" period
  - what if an effect takes time to get going? or fades out?
- We can also estimate a **dynamic effect** where we allow the effect to be different at different time periods since the treatment
- To implement an event-study specification
  - interact a binary indicator for being in the treated group with binary indicators for time period 
  - impose the normalisation $\delta_{-1} = 0$, which is the coefficient for the last period before the treatment, otherwise you get perfect multicollinearity
$$Y_{gt} = \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{t - \tau_g}D_{gt} + U_{gt}$$
where 
  - $\tau_g$ is the moment of the treatment
  - $t$ is time period
  - `feols()` makes this easy with its `i()` interaction function
- Then, just plot these estimates

---

# DiD: event-study specification

- Let us make a more concrete example
- Suppose we have $6$ time periods: $3$ periods before and $3$ periods after
  - so $t = 6$ and $\tau_g = 4$
- Then our model is as follows
\begin{align*}
  Y_{gt} &= \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{t - \tau_g}D_{gt} + U_{gt} \\
  &= \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{1 - 4}D_{g1} + \delta_{2 - 4}D_{g2} + \delta_{3 - 4}D_{g3} \\
  &+ \delta_{4 - 4}D_{g4} + \delta_{5 - 4}D_{g5} + \delta_{6 - 4}D_{g6} + U_{gt} \\
  &= \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{-3}D_{g1} + \delta_{-2}D_{g2} + \delta_{-1}D_{g3} + \delta_{0}D_{g4} + \delta_{1}D_{g5} + \delta_{2}D_{g6} + U_{gt}
\end{align*}
where 
  - $\delta_{-3}, \delta_{-2}, \delta_{-1}$ are coefficients of the "effect" before the treatment period
  - $\delta_{-1} = 0$ which is the coefficient for the last period before the treatment 
  - $\delta_{0}, \delta_{1}, \delta_{2}$ are coefficients of the effect after the treatment period

---

# Parallel trends

- For the DiD to work we have to pick the control group 
  - we need a control group for which parallel trends holds
  - if there had been no treatment, both treated and control groups would have had the same time effect
- We can't check this directly, since it's counterfactual
  - we can only check whether it is plausible
- DiD gives us a causal effect as long as **the only reason the gap changed** was the treatment
  - this is called **parallel trends assumption**
- The parallel trends assumption means that if the treatment had not happened, the gap between the two groups would have stayed the same
- There are two main ways we can use test the plausibility of parallel trends
  - First, we can check for differences in **prior trends**
  - Second, we can do a **placebo test**

---

# Parallel trends: prior trends

- You can check whether the assumption is plausible by seeing if **prior trends** are the same for treated and control groups
  - if we have multiple pre-treatment periods, was the gap changing a lot during that period?
- If the two groups were already trending towards each other, or away from each other, before treatment, it is hard to believe that parallel trends hold
- They **probably** would have continued trending together/apart, breaking parallel trends
  - in this case we would mix up the continuation of the trend with the effect of treatment
- Sometimes you can adjust for prior trends to fix parallel trends violations 
  - by including a time variable directly
  - or by using a synthetic control method
- Just because **prior trends** are equal does not mean that **parallel trends** holds
  - **parallel trends** is about what the before-after change **would have been** and we can't see that
  - but it can be **suggestive**

---

# Parallel trends: prior trends

- Recall the formula we used in an event-study framework
\begin{align*}
  Y_{gt} &= \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{t - \tau_g}D_{gt} + U_{gt} \\
  &= \alpha_t + \eta_g + \delta_{-3}D_{g1} + \delta_{-2}D_{g2} + \delta_{-1}D_{g3} + \delta_{0}D_{g4} + \delta_{1}D_{g5} + \delta_{2}D_{g6} + U_{gt}
\end{align*}
- To check parallel pre-trends, test if $\delta_{-3}, \delta_{-2}$ are jointly significant
  - you can do so with `wald()` in `fixest` package
- If they are jointly insignificant, there is no evidence of differences in prior trends
  - that doesn't **prove** parallel trends but failing this test would make prior trends **less plausible**
- You can also check more complex time trends by including polynomial terms or other nonlinearities

---

# Parallel trends: placebo

- Many causal inference designs can be tested using **placebo tests**
- To implement a placebo test
  - use only the data that came before the treatment went into effect
  - pick a fake treatment period
  - estimate the same DiD model you used
  - if you find an "effect", that is evidence that there is something wrong with your design, which may imply a violation of parallel trends

---

# Parallel trends: placebo

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Remember the first treated period was period 7
df_fake <- df %>%
  filter(year < 7) %>%
  # pick a fake treatment period
  mutate(post1 = ifelse(year >= 4, 1, 0),
         post2 = ifelse(year >= 5, 1, 0),
         D1 = post1*treated, 
         D2 = post2*treated)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df_fake %>%
  slice(c(5997:6000)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Parallel trends: placebo

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# The true effect is 3
library(fixest)
m1 <- feols(Y ~ D1 | year + group, df_fake)
m2 <- feols(Y ~ D2 | year + group, df_fake)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
msummary(list(m1, m2), stars = TRUE, gof_omit = '^(?!Num)')
```

- There is no "effect" of our fake treatment which is a good sign

---

# Parallel trends: some remarks

- Sometimes you will find significant effects while testing parallel pre-trends or by using a placebo
- However, for both prior trends and placebo tests, we are a little less concerned with **significance** than with **meaningful size** of the violations
  - after all, with enough sample size **anything** is significant
  - and if fake treatment effects are fairly tiny, you can argue these effects away

---

# DiD as two-way fixed effects: problems

- One common variant of difference-in-difference is the **rollout design**, in which there are multiple treated groups, each being treated at a different time
  - rollout designs are possibly the most common form of DiD you see
- As discovered recently, two-way fixed effects **does not** work to estimate DiD when you have a rollout design
  - think about what fixed effects does - it leaves you only with within variation
  - two types of individuals without **any** within variation between periods A and B: the never-treated and the already-treated
  - so the already-treated can end up getting used as controls in a rollout
- This becomes a big problem especially if the effect grows/shrinks over time

---

# DiD as two-way fixed effects: solutions

- There are a few new estimators that deal with rollout designs properly
  - Goodman-Bacon (2021)
  - Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)
- They take each period of treatment and consider the group treated **on that particular period**
- They explicitly only use untreated groups as controls
- And they also use **matching** to improve the selection of control groups for each period's treated group
- We will not go into these methods, but it is good to know for your future research
